# data-structures
* This repository is a collection of source files, each of which implements a different data structure

* Most of these are written in C but I may switch them up from time to time just for the sake of using a different language

* My favorite CS professor always made a point of distributing source files for whichever data structure or algorithm he was teaching that he would litter with very detailed notes in the form of comments. So this repository is simply continuing that trend
